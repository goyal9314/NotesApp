## Q/A
* Q1. What are your thoughts on a decentralized internet? Do you think finance canbe decentralized in coming years?
* Ans. I think decentralized internet is better as it is mainly focused
on privacy and data security.
a large community of users and independent machines would run the things, which would make it less vulnerable to attack.
In decentralized internet by using blockchain-based platforms attacks
can be avoided.
But I think there is some problem with decentralized internet.
There is not a place for government regulation, that is potentially
problematic in some circumstances.

    I don't think finance can be decentralized in the coming year.
As I know we get loans only on our deposited money from Defi
but from banks, we can get different types of loans also.

* Q2. What are your thoughts on a decentralized internet? Do you think finance canbe decentralized in coming years?
* Ans. I used to watch video on youtube from some specific channels and reading some documentation for keeping things to up to date.
some are: edureka!, slideherd, Android developer documentation.
